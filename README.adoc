== zatsu

記録ベースで現実的な計画を自動で立ててくれるソフトウェアです｡
zatsu is a highly-customizable scheduling software that makes the day of lazy people (like me) more efficient and happy.

=== Installation

The installation should be done using simple commands like below but I have not published zatsu in the rubygems repository, so you can run `git clone` and `bundle exec rake install` instead.
```ruby
$ gem install zatsu
```

=== Usage

Refer to https://scrapbox.io/sei0opub/Roadmap (The guide is only available in Japanese but you can always read the code!).

=== Contribution

PRs and issues are welcome. You can also write and share your own generators/schedulers/estimators.
Since this is my completely personal project and I'm going to create what I love, so please don't expect me to react/merge all of the PRs or issues. :)
